# TypeScript Backend Application Readme

## Description

This repository contains a TypeScript backend application built with Express.js and MongoDB. It provides a starting point for developing server-side applications in TypeScript. The application uses a sample `.env.example` file to store environment variables, and you will need to configure these variables to run the application successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`. You can do this by copying the `.env.example` and renaming it to `.env`. Update the values to match your configuration.

   ```plaintext
   SECRET = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
   MONGO_URL = "mongodb://localhost:27017/biodrop"
   PASSWORD = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
   PORT = 4000
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

## Development

If you want to make changes to the application or develop new features, you can run the application in development mode with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the source code.

## API Endpoints

The application provides various API endpoints for interacting with the data stored in the MongoDB database. You can find the routes and their descriptions in the source code.

## Deployment

This application is a starting point for your TypeScript backend. To deploy it in a production environment, you may need to configure a production-ready server, set up security measures, and manage environment variables securely. Be sure to follow best practices for deploying Node.js applications in a production environment.
